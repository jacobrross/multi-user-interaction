overview

There are four different blocks in each window that are aligned with each other. In one screen the blocks are 3D and in the other they are 2D. 
Each block is a slightly different size and they are scaled the same for each window, i.e. the length and width of the block on the left of each 
window are the same. The goal of the game is to pick the largest block. The 2D user guesses and if they guess right the corresponding block in the 
3D window dissapears and their screen goes green. If they are wrong it stays there and their screen goes red. The 3D then chooses which block is the
biggest and it disspears with click and so on. The goal of the game/expirement is to see if it is easier to spot differences with 3 dimensions or with 
2.

challenging

I found it very challenging getting the erase function to work with the web socket.

went well

Formatting in CSS and making the blocks delete in A-Frame from clicking.
